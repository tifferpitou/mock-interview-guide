# Design question

You are tasked with designing a simple library management system in an object-oriented programming language of your choice. The system should support books and patrons. Each book has a title, author, and unique ISBN. Each patron has a name, a unique patron ID, and can borrow books from the library.

Design the classes and relationships for this library management system. Ensure that you provide methods for:

1) Adding a new book to the library.
2) Removing a book from the library when it's borrowed.
3) Allowing patrons to borrow and return books.
4) Displaying the list of books a patron has borrowed.

Please provide the class definitions, including constructors and methods, and explain how these classes are related and how they ensure the integrity of the library system. Additionally, you can provide a simple code snippet that demonstrates how to use these classes to add books, manage patron interactions, and display borrowed books.

This question assesses the candidate's ability to design and implement a basic object-oriented system with proper class definitions, relationships, and methods while considering data integrity and user interactions.
