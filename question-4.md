# Design question (easy)

Of course, here's a simpler object-oriented design question for an interview:

**Question:**

Design a basic system for modeling geometric shapes in an object-oriented manner. Consider two shapes: circles and rectangles. Each shape should have the following properties and methods:

**Circle:**
- Properties: radius
- Methods: area, circumference

**Rectangle:**
- Properties: width, height
- Methods: area, perimeter

Additionally, create a base class called `Shape` that these shapes inherit from, which should include a method to calculate the color (but you can assume a constant color for this simplified system).

Design the classes and relationships for this system. Provide class definitions for `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Shape`, including constructors and methods. Also, create a simple code snippet to demonstrate how to create objects of these classes, set their properties, and calculate their areas or perimeters.

This question assesses the candidate's ability to design a basic object-oriented system with inheritance, encapsulation, and method implementation for different classes.
