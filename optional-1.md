# Design question (medium)

**Question:**

You are tasked with designing a simple library management system in an object-oriented programming language of your choice. The system should support books and patrons. Each book has a title, author, and unique ISBN. Each patron has a name, a unique patron ID, and can borrow books from the library.

Design the classes and relationships for this library management system. Ensure that you provide methods for:

1. Adding a new book to the library.
2. Removing a book from the library when it's borrowed.
3. Allowing patrons to borrow and return books.
4. Displaying the list of books a patron has borrowed.
